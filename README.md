# Final Year Project

### "Mental Health Companion" is a term that refers to a range of digital applications, tools, and services that are designed to support mental health and wellbeing. These can include mobile apps, chatbots, online communities, and teletherapy platforms. Mental Health Companions are intended to provide users with easy access to mental health resources and support, often using techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness meditation to help users manage stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. Some Mental Health Companions may also provide personalized recommendations, progress tracking, and other features to help users improve their mental health outcomes.
